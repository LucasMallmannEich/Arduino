Arduino is a group of IDE, programming language and eletronics circuit that is really used to control the temperature, moviment sensors and others functions in the eletronics field.        
It has the inputs and the outputs.          
The Arduino Input's receive an information, that will be processed by it's microcontroller. Ex.: a button actuation.        
The Arduino Output's send an information to  some object or eletronic component, that is, they make some action. Ex.: to light up a LED.
